# Products Page - Fixed & Ready! ✅

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ API Integration

### 2. ✅ Add to Cart Button
- Added prominent "Add to Cart" button on every product card
- Button is visible at all times (not just on hover)
- Positioned outside the Link to prevent navigation
- Beautiful gradient styling (purple to pink)
- Shopping cart icon included

### 3. ✅ Product Display
- Products display correctly on `/products` page
- Category filtering works

### Step 1: Start the Application

```powershell
# Make sure you're in the vibeDesi directory

## Troubleshooting

### No products showing?
**Solution**: Make sure backend is running
```bash
cd server && npm run dev
```

### Products not loading?
**Solution**: Check browser console (F12) for errors

### Can't add to cart?
**Solution**: Check if Redux store is properly configured

### Filter not working?
**Solution**: Verify backend API is running on port 5000
